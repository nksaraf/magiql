# Introduction

`relay-compiler` as a `graphql` tag. 

* Transforms AST from the `graphql` parser to best approximation of `relay-compiler` AST 
* Used by `magiql` to enable `relay-runtime` (uptil now required the build-time setup of `relay-compiler` and `babel-relay-plugin`).
* Can still be used when types are generated by `relay-compiler` and you don't want a custom Babel config

## Differences

**Difference**: 
Can't autodetect fragments across documents

**Alternative**: 
Parser accepts the following syntax to include fragments (thanks to tagged template literals):
  ```tsx
  const Pokemon_pokemon = graphql`
    fragment Pokemon_pokemon on Pokemon {
       id
       name
    }
  `;
  
  const PokemonsQuery = graphql`
    query PokemonsQuery {
      pokemons(first: 10) {
        id
        // fragment included in interpolation after ... is interpreted as fragment
        ...${Pokemon_pokemon}
      }
    }
  `
  ```
  - Still have to import fragments _(Can attach fragments as properties of components but could simply just export them)_
  - Still have to declare fragments outside components
  - _Can transforming using regex find and replace. (Makes it easy to switch to the `relay-compiler`)_
  

**Difference:** 
Can't detect which selection sets are lists

**Alternative:** 
This can be easily worked out at runtime:
* Data in response would contain lists which can be detected while normalizing
* While reading from store, when a list of recordIDs is detected

**Difference:** 
Can't generate types

**Alternative:** 
Use `graphql-code-generator` _(adaptor coming soon...)_

_Might have missed more differences but these are the ones I notice._

## Motivation

_**Disclaimer:** This is NOT meant to discourage the use of `relay-compiler`, on the contrary, this is actually meant to be a gateway to it, encourage it. If you are considering using it, USE IT. The `magiql/cli` and `magiql/babel` exports are also installed when you install `magiql` which wrap the `relay-compiler`, `relay-config` and `babel-plugin-relay` packages into a preconfigured package designed for Typescript. They are designed to make it easy to switch to the compiler anytime._

**To use `relay-runtime` easily**. 

Currently, it is necessary to use the `relay-compiler` which is an amazing piece of technology. (if you 

- GraphQL Schema-aware development tooling
  - Typescript code-generation
  - Build-time validation of GraphQL Documentation
- GraphQL parsing is done at build time (gets skipped at runtime for better performance)
- Don't have to include `graphql` package in bundle
- Auto detects fragments without having to import them between files
- **Fragment-focused parsing which drives the relay-runtime**

There are also some interrupts on the way, which motivate this package

- GraphQL schema needed locally
- Strict rules for naming of GraphQL documents (can be seen as an advantage as well)
- Additional build-time step required for smaller projects
  - Difficult to use in CodeSandbox and similar environments
- Have to include Babel setup and customize it
- Can't use `relay-runtime` without it (`relay-runtime` is also amazing)

How it works:
  * `relay-compiler` looks for `graphql` tags in your project
  * produces typescript files for each fragment, query, etc. with parsed document and types
  * parsed document follows the Relay AST structure (AST that `relay-runtime` understands)
  * `babel-plugin-relay` replaces the `graphql` tag at build time to `require` statements pointing to the artifacts the `relay-compiler` generated,
  eg. 
  ```tsx
  const Pokemon_pokemon = graphql`
    fragment Pokemon_pokemon on Pokemon {
       id
       name
    }
  `;
  
  // will be transformed to
  
  const Pokemon_pokemon = require('../__generated__/Pokemon_pokemon.graphql.ts')
  ```
